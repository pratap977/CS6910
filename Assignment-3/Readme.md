# cs6910_assignment3
For Recurrent Neural Networks

1.This repo contains 2 Folders Attention and Without_Attention.Without_Attention contains the answers for Q2,Q3 and Q4.

2.Attention contains the answers for the Q5 and Q6.

3.Each folder directory has further 2 ipython notebooks .One  with _sweep_ as sufffix is for hyperparameter runs  and other with suffix _Test_ is
for the final training of the model using best hyperparameters.Also ahev a .txt file which contains the predictions made by the corresponding model on test data.

4.Additional Nirmala.ttf font and venilla_predictions.dictionary files provided which needed to be downloaded and uploaded to the colab session.

5.Prediction contains the predictions made by Attention model and Without_Attention model is saved as .csv files

6.For testing of code use the ipynb file suffixed with _Test.
